show dir:
	netrwPlugin.vim
	use vim open dir
	vim dir name
	:tabe .

switch to file
	normal mode: gf under file name

open file in new window(horizontal)
	sfind + filename


A nice way to directly start Vim to edit a file somewhere in the 'path':
	vim "+find stdio.h"


CTRL-w gf
    Open a new tab page and edit the file name under the cursor.
CTRL-w gF
    Open a new tab page and edit the file name under the cursor and jump to the line number following the file name.
